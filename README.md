Spotr

Spotr is an iPhone app developed as part of a hackthon that required the use of Core Location. It allows the user to select from one of four search options, which then makes a call to the Google nearby API with the phone's coordinates, and then places the results in augmented reality in their actual direction from the user, utilizing the phone's magentometer and compass feature.

Key features:
  -Google API use
  -Phone Geolocation
  -Magentometer/Compass
  -Augmented Reality
